# Implementation Map: Eco 100K First Runnable

Type: implementation-map
Status: ready-for-agent
Blocked by: none

## Parent specification

- [First Runnable Independent Workflow Platform — Eco 100K](../first-runnable-platform/spec.md)

## Frontier

- Tickets 01 through 09 are complete. Ticket 10 is the current frontier; its
  bounded native success/empty/restart slice is pinned-verified, while runtime
  fault-injection acceptance remains. A later ticket becomes frontier when
  every ticket listed in its `Blocked by` field is complete.

## Completion gate

- Ticket 21 certifies the release only after every direct and transitive blocker is complete and the external evidence manifest passes.

## Recovered status reconciliation — 2026-09-14

The ticket evidence and pinned verification now record Tickets 01 through 09
as complete. Ticket 10 has a pinned-verified bounded native Merge slice, with
runtime fault-injection acceptance still outstanding; no later core ticket is
claimed complete by this map. Ticket 09's public acceptance workflow and
companion validation runs are recorded in its ticket and operations guide.

The shared GitHub Wayfinder map is [#2](https://github.com/Catzpro01/n8n-rust-v3.0/issues/2).
The broader decision tickets are recorded in the expansion map. The retained
Rust + connected Preact baseline remains the implementation surface; do not
delete it or restart with a new frontend framework.
