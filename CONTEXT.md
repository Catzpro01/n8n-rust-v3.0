# Project context

## Product intent

Build an independently authored, self-hosted workflow-automation platform with
a Rust execution core, a browser-capable editor, durable workflow revisions,
node-based execution, persistence, and observable execution status. The product
may offer interactions familiar to n8n users and staged public compatibility,
but it must not copy n8n source, Enterprise code, tests, protected assets,
branding, product copy, icons, or distinctive trade dress.

The recovered implementation is called **Canopy Workbench** for now. The name
and geometric editor mark remain placeholders and are not a final branding
decision.

## Recovered implementation baseline

The four uploaded split archive parts were concatenated and verified as a
complete ZIP. The recovered `workflow-rust` project is now merged at the
repository root. It is the baseline to continue, not a disposable prototype.

The baseline includes:

- a Rust 1.85.1 workspace with `node-contract` and `workflowd` crates;
- a Rust daemon with embedded TypeScript/Preact editor assets;
- bundled SQLite startup and durable draft, publication, run, artifact, and
  causal-trace paths;
- Manual Trigger execution, bounded Generate Items, encrypted Artifacts,
  reconnectable progress, cancellation, checkpoint/replay, and recovery;
- 56 retained ADRs, dependency-ordered `.scratch` tickets, node contracts,
  acceptance tests, release tooling, and systemd packaging;
- an existing independent clean-room policy and public-semantic compatibility
  approach.

The previous implementation's evidence is historical evidence imported under
`docs/legacy/session-archive/`. It is not a claim that those checks were rerun
in this checkout.

## Current planning decisions

- GitHub Issues remain the shared tracker; detailed recovered implementation
  specs remain under `.scratch/`.
- The root context plus `docs/adr/` remain the durable domain-decision layout.
- The local `cache.kv` index is discovery-only and never a source of truth.
- Codebase Memory MCP is optional and unavailable in this environment; do not
  claim graph results that were not obtained.
- On 2026-09-13 the Owner selected an architecture spike first. After recovery,
  that means a reversible audit/reconciliation of the existing Rust + connected
  Preact editor baseline before adding new production behavior—not discarding it
  to start again with Dioxus, Leptos, or another framework.
- Existing recovered ADRs are retained. Any new architecture choice must first
  compare against them and explicitly supersede a prior ADR if necessary.

## Retained decisions and approval gates

The recovered project already made consequential decisions that remain active:

- private/personal-first deployment with an independently authored editor;
- Rust-native default production execution, with isolated/remote compatibility
  lanes for heavier or non-Rust behavior;
- single-host-first deployment with distributed seams;
- a connected Preact/Canvas editor behind a client seam;
- immutable Workflow Revisions compiled into pinned Execution Plans;
- durable at-least-once execution with deterministic replay and causal traces;
- bounded Envelopes and encrypted, streamed Artifacts rather than unbounded
  in-memory item materialization;
- mutable Drafts separated from published revisions;
- capability-based egress and scoped Secret Leases;
- native nodes, isolated compatibility workers, staged conformance fixtures,
  visible compatibility aliases, and versioned compatibility profiles;
- local recovery before off-site storage, signed release slots, and verified
  rollback/recovery;
- Workflow Hub, Skill Hub, agent-engine routing, scoped memory, and remote-first
  heavy execution remain planned extension surfaces rather than reasons to
  weaken the first runnable's resource and security boundaries.

Ticket 07's frozen Owner decisions are preserved exactly in
`docs/legacy/session-archive/DECISIONS.md` and the Ticket 07 local ticket. In
particular, retain its deterministic `{index, value, data}` item shape, the
logical-versus-physical Envelope distinction, Owner-scoped keyed Artifact
identity with chunked XChaCha20-Poly1305, crash-safe staged placement, the
50,000-item and 64 MiB/32 MiB hard budgets, progressive checkpoints, typed
outcomes, and lease/quarantine protections.

Ticket 08 is **not approved for production implementation**. Its recommended
Eco transformation, assignment model, safe expression subset, and Missing/
time/random semantics remain proposals until the Owner explicitly confirms
them. Do not infer approval from the recovered code or from silence.

## Wayfinder checkpoint

The GitHub map is [#2](https://github.com/Catzpro01/n8n-rust-v3.0/issues/2), with
child decision issues #3–#7. The recovered local implementation map is
`.scratch/eco-100k-first-runnable/map.md` and is more detailed for execution.
The next safe action is to inspect and reconcile the recovered baseline with
those decisions, then continue from Ticket 08's explicit approval gate.

## Security boundary

The uploaded recovery archive contained historical SSH material outside the
application source. It was deliberately not imported into this repository.
Never copy private keys, credentials, cookies, recovery phrases, tokens, or
secret paths into Git, context, tickets, or handoffs. Any exposed historical
key must be rotated/revoked by the Owner.
